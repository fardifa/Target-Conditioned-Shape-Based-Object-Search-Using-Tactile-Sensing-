# Target-Conditioned-Shape-Based-Object-Search-Using-Tactile-Sensing-
This repository contains the project code for ECE 699: Robot Learning.  
The project explores tactile-based object search and recognition using reinforcement learning and simulation in MuJoCo.

torch torchvision torchaudio 'stable-baselines3[extra]==2.3.2' pandas scikit-learn tqdm tensorboard pyyaml seaborn
```
### 1.3 Install the MuJoCo Desktop App (optional but recommended)

Download the .dmg installer for macOS from
🔗 https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/releases

Open the .dmg and drag MuJoCo.app into your Applications folder.

## 2. Clone and Organize the Project Repository
Clone this repository and navigate into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Target-Conditioned-Shape-Based-Object-Search-Using-Tactile-Sensing.git

## 3. Train to Generate Dataset (optional)
To create your own tactile dataset, you must simulate each object separately.  
Each object has its own MuJoCo XML scene and a corresponding Python script  
that collects force data during probing.

### 3.1 Generate Force CSV Files

For each object (sphere, cube, cylinder, cone), run its data collection script.

Example:

```bash
mjpython sphere_data.py
mjpython square_data.py
mjpython scene_cylinder.py
mjpython scene_cone.py
```
Each script will:

* Load the object-specific MuJoCo scene (e.g., scene_sphere.xml)
* Perform a series of tactile probing motions
* Record force readings and pad positions
* Save the results as a CSV file in the dataset folder

You should end up with files such as: sphere_force.csv, cube_force.csv etc.
### 3.2 Convert Force Data into Tactile Images

Once all force CSV files are generated, convert them into tactile images:
```bash
python generate_tactile_images.py
```
This script will read each force CSV file, generate pseudo-GelSight images (heatmaps) and save the images into: **dataset/images/<object_name>/**

## 4. Train Classifier (optional)
The tactile shape classifier (ConvNeXt/CNN) is trained using a Jupyter Notebook  
because GPU acceleration (Google Colab) significantly speeds up training.

To train the classifier:

1. Open the notebook Tactile_Shape_Classifier.ipynb and upload to Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook
2. Set the runtime to **GPU** (Recommended GPUs: **NVIDIA L4**, **A100** or similar)
3. Run all cells in the notebook to:
   - Load the tactile dataset
   - Train the classifier on: `sphere`, `cube`, `cylinder`, `cone`
   - Export the trained model weights

The notebook will generate a file named: **best_tactile_classifier_convnet.pth**
Download this file and place it inside:
final scene
├── best_tactile_classifier_convnet.pth
## 5. Train PPO (optional)
This is optional as a .pth file is already shared. PPO can be trained directly using the script inside `final_scene/`.

Navigate to the folder:

```bash
cd final_scene
```

Run 

```bash
mjpython train_ppo.py
```

This will train a tactile search policy for the chosen target object.

## 6. Run the Final Tactile Search System (inside `final_scene/`)

All final runnable scripts for this project are located in the `final_scene/` directory.  
Navigate into the folder:

```bash
cd final_scene
```
#### 6.1 Run Baseline Manual Active Search

To run the manual baseline version, run:

```bash
mjpython main.py
```

When prompted:

```bash
Select mode (manual/ppo/train_ppo): manual
Enter target object: cube
```

This will:

* Load the MuJoCo tactile scene (Search_scene.xml)

* Touch each object (sphere → cube → cylinder → cone)

* Generate pseudo-GelSight images during contact

* Fuse classifier predictions incrementally

* Stop early if the target is confidently identified

#### 6.2 Multi-Object PPO Tactile Search (Reinforcement Learning)
This mode runs the full target-conditioned tactile search using a trained PPO policy.

Run:

```bash
mjpython multi_object_search_ppo.py
```

When prompted:

```bash
Enter target object for PPO multi-object search: cube
Enter PPO model path: 1000_ppo_policy.pth
```
This will:

* Initialize PPO environment (tactile_env.py)

* Run multi-step tactile episodes

* Learn when to explore, reject, or confirm
